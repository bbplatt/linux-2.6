	  Enable kernel support for MaverickCrunch.

config CR1_NFBIT
	bool "Turn on nF bit in ControlRegister 1"
	help
	  Say 'Y' here to force the nF bit on.  Usually this is set
	  by the bootrom.  If it is not set, then the CPU core will
	  run from HCLK instead of FCLK, and performance will suffer.
	  If you see BogoMIPS of about 1/4 of your CPU clock, try
	  turning this on; your performance should double.
